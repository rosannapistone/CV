Laboration 2 - Interactive CV

Task description<br>
The purpose of this lab was to create a digital CV with interactive features. 

What I did<br>
I have developed a CV that reflects me, both with design and layout. I have used colors and fonts that I like, personally. Most of the content is hidden behind colorful blocks that describes the content. The content is then displayed with hover effect. The CV is adapted for all units, in other words responsive. The hover effect for touch devices has been replaced by click-events.
